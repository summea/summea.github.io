          <h5>Check-In Check-Out 2 (2020-Present)</h5>
          <p>
            A rebuild of the previous Check-In Check-Out web application due to a software issue between Django and SQL Server in relation to UUID database values. The new version was built with Laravel 7 and was later upgraded to Laravel 8. This web application is used to help instructors and staff input data for positive student behavior and critical incidents where events impacting something (e.g., classroom instructional time) happen. Then, this data can be retrieved in the application or through paginated SSRS reports in the Student Information System [1]. Much of the data is stored in the related Student Information System (SIS) backend SQL Server database, while some other program-specific data is stored in a local MySQL database.

          <h5>Check-In Check-Out (2019-2020)</h5>
          <p>
            A simple web application project that allows users to add and manage student behavior data. I think this is used especially for student-related positive behavior and critical incident data entry and reporting. For some time, this program was used by staff in the school district, but was later replaced by Check-In Check-Out 2 in 2020.

          <h5>Upload Portal (2019-Present)</h5>
          <p>
            An extremely simple web application for uploading and managing files. I hesitate to include this in the project list because this is more of a trivial application. If it is helpful in the future, there might be room to work on this more, but for now this is a simple web application that was more of an introduction to using Django for something useful.<br /><br />
            <b>Update (2021):</b> This application has turned out to be useful for times where it's difficult to transfer files from one server to another. In particular, when transferring something from an older Windows Server elsewhere, this application was an easier way to safely transfer files.

          <h5>Mailing List Sync (2018-Present)</h5>
          <p>
            Scripts that sync mailing lists between Google Groups and Mailman. This project is a collection of individual Perl scripts that:
            <ol>
              <li>Get a list of all available organization mailing lists from Ume API</li>
              <li>Get all members of each individual list using Google's API</li>
              <li>Save found members to individual lists for Mailman</li>
              <li>Import mailing list changes into Mailman</li>
              <li>Update sending rights for users with mailing list changes</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            Previously, this project ran the first three steps all at one time, but this led to times where Ume API was so busy with the related requests that it couldn't handle new incoming requests. Thus, there would be times where Ume API was unavailable during some of the processing taking place with the Mailing List Sync. In 2020, there was the idea to address this unavailability issue by using the task queue program called Celery. So now, when requests for mailing list members are made, they are taken up as tasks to run independently, so Ume API now can fire off tasks and provides a result URL that can be checked for when the task is completed. Once completed, the desired information is returned without causing a slowdown for Ume API, which means that it can continue to handle other incoming requests as expected.<br /><br />

          <p>A system for managing user accounts between local database, Active Directory, and Google. Expanded upon the work done by previous developers in this position by incorporating actively-used requirements into a new system of interconnected applications or other items.</p>

            <li>
              <h5>User Management (2017-Present) – web application</h5>
              <p>
                This web application was built as a means to add, edit, and manage staff (and to a limited amount, student) user accounts for a small to medium user base. With this web application, certain user account changes in User Management are able to be synced with Active Directory and Google when changes are made.<br /><br />
                Wrote many feature and unit tests over time for this web application. Having a test suite has been helpful in ensuring that things are working as intended after making changes and has also been really helpful for times of refactoring and reorganization.<br /><br />                
                After learning more, began to heavily reorganize this web application in 2021 with the intent of possibly refactoring code where helpful. Began breaking up huge class files (regular program and test related class files) into smaller, more-focused classes.<br />

          Have worked with CentOS in production since Fall 2016. Began with CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 (if I remember correctly) that were running in production when I started my Programmer Analyst job. Someone else at my work (B) spins up virtual machines for servers related to my area of work, but I generally manage these servers over time. Began using CentOS 8 in production in 2020. Updates were generally run throughout the year to keep the servers up to date, but tried to be more consistent with this by running updates once a month on an ongoing basis since 2020 (if I remember correctly).<br /><br />

          Have worked with Windows Server 2016 in production since Spring 2017 [2][3]. I began running updates on a monthly basis in 2021.<br /><br />

            Music composition is often more than randomly selecting musical notes—it involves logical patterns, progressions, and emotions. The goal of the KANJOTO project is to teach a machine to generate music based upon selected emotion options using the Android platform. For example, if I wanted to hear music that sounds "happy", I would choose the "happy" emotion and the program would play generated music that is based on past "happy" labeled musical patterns.<br /><br />
            This was a senior project that was worked on especially throughout the school year, and I had the opportunity to talk about the program over time and demonstrate the program in class. Near the end of the school year, there was also some sort of event where students had the opportunity to have a "booth" where senior projects could be demonstrated to students and visitors (including representatives from companies).<br /><br />

          <p>
            Kask Kiosk was a team-based project for junior year at school written primarily in C#. This project provides a basic implementation of a job application kiosk where users can fill out and submit sample job applications. If I remember correctly, I think I worked more on the web application side of this project, while other members of the group might have worked on that part as well or on other parts like the database, etc.<br />
