          <h5>User Management (2016-present)</h5>
          <p>A system for managing user accounts between local database, Active Directory, and Google. Expanded upon the work done by previous developers in this position by incorporating active requirements into a new system of interconnected applications, components, and services.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>User Management – web application
              <p>
                This web application was built as a means to add, edit, and manage staff (and to a limited amount, student) user accounts for a small to medium user base. Certain user account changes in User Management were synced with Active Directory and Google when changes were made.<br>

            <li>Student Data Sync – component<br>
              <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
                The Student Data Sync program is made up of a variety of utilities that deal with:
                <ul style="margin-bottom:0;">
                  <li>Blank Email Accounts</li>
                  <li>Graduated Accounts</li>
                  <li>New Accounts</li>
                  <li>Mass Update</li>
                  <li>Withdrawn Accounts</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>Message Receiver for Windows – component
              <p>
                This program was built to listen for input passed along from the User Management web application and Student Data Sync component via RabbitMQ. The RabbitMQ approach was later phased out in favor of a web API approach with the Directory API project.<br>

            <li>Message Receiver Service – service
              <p>
                This service was built to run the Message Receiver for Windows program.<br>

          <h5>Mailing List Sync (2019?)</h5>
          <p>
            Scripts that sync mailing lists between Google Groups and Mailman. This project is a collection of individual Perl scripts that:
            <ol>
              <li>Get a list of all available organization mailing lists from Ume API</li>
              <li>Get all members of each individual list using Google's API</li>
              <li>Save found members to individual lists for Mailman</li>
              <li>Import mailing list changes into Mailman</li>
              <li>Update sending rights for users with mailing list changes</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Previously, this project ran the first three steps all at one time, but this led to times where Ume API was so busy with the related requests that it couldn't handle new incoming requests. Thus, there would be times where Ume API was unavailable during some of the processing taking place with the Mailing List Sync. In 2020, there was the idea to address this unavailability issue by using the task queue program called Celery. So now, when requests for mailing list members are made, they are taken up as tasks to run independently, so Ume API now can fire off tasks and provides a result URL that can be checked for when the task is completed. Once completed, the desired information is returned without causing a slowdown for Ume API, which means that it can continue to handle other incoming requests as expected.

          <h5>Upload Portal (2019)</h5>
          <p>
            An extremely simple web application for uploading and managing files. I hesitate to include this in the project list because this is more of a trivial application. If it is helpful in the future, there might be room to work on this more, but for now this is a simple web application that was more of an introduction to using Django for something useful.<br>

          <p>
            Music composition is often more than randomly selecting musical notes—it involves logical patterns, progressions, and emotions. The goal of the KANJOTO project is to teach a machine to generate music based upon given emotions using the Android platform.<br>
